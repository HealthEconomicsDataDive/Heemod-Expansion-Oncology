Aim: Handle more detailed application of drug costs (or other cost categories) for example fixed treatment durtions or a time on treatment curves in an oncology HTA model.

Ideas:
3 state oncology model (Progression Free, Progressed and dead)
Take data from a simple source or come with it ourselves?
Apply a 2 year treatment duration
Apply a parametric time on treatment curve (simple exponential which we can vary in the PSA?)
Apply within the progression free health state vs duplicating the health states (e.g PFS on treatment and PFS off treatment)?
